# Recipe 1 #

- One part Mulled cider (recipe available [here](../../Soft/mulled.md))
- One part Red Wine
 - **Note:** Depending on the concentration of the cider, you may change this ratio to taste.

##Steps:##

1. Heat the cider just below a boil.
 - **Word of caution:** Do not warm for longer than absolutely necessary, the cider has already been reduced and further reduction will change the character of the resultant mulled wine.
2. Add the wine and bring the whole mixture to the temperature you want for drinking.
 - **Note:** The longer you heat the wine the more the alcohol will evaporate, changing the overall flavor.

Enjoy.

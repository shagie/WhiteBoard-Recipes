- 1.5 oz Bourbon or Rye (classic recipe calls for Rye, both work well though)
- So called "Perfect" (my preference, anecdotally better with Bourbon than Rye):
 - 0.5 oz Sweet vermouth
 - 0.5 oz Dry vermouth
- If not "Perfect":
 - 0.75 oz Sweet vermouth
- 2-4 splashes of Angostura Bitters depending on how much you like them
- If available: One maraschino cherry
 - Optionally: A splash of maraschino cherry juice
- ice

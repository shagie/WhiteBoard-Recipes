**Abstract:** The original purpose of grog was for sailers to be both peaceable and staying hydrated with something disinfected. This is obviously not a worthwhile reason to drink it now. Presently I encourage this drink for two reasons:

1. It brings out the flavor of the rum, in much the same way as a dab of water does for whiskey. (Decent rum is required for this reason)
2. It's a pleasantly refreshing drink on a hot day as it is mostly water.

----

- Tall glass 1/3rd full of ice
- 1.5 oz Dark rum
 - **NOT spiced or white rum**. Examples of good dark rum: Myers, Cruzan, Mount Gay, Pussers, Appleton Estate.
- 2.5-3 oz Water
- 0.5 oz Lemon juice
- Optional: 0.25-0.75 oz Honey or simple syrup if you find the flavor wanting; depending on your preference for sour. Honey must be mixed with luke warm water before adding, or it will stay precipitate.

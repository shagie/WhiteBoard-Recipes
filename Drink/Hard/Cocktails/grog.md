**Abstract:** The original purpose of grog was for sailers to be both peaceable and staying hydrated with something disinfected. This is obviously not a worthwhile reason to drink it now. Presently I encourage this drink for two reasons:

1. It brings out the flavor of the rum, in much the same way as a dab of water does for whiskey. (Decent rum is required for this reason)
2. It's a pleasantly refreshing drink on a hot day as it is mostly water.

----

- 1.5 oz Dark rum
 - **NOT spiced or white rum**. Examples of good dark rum: Myers, Cruzan, Mount Gay, Pussers, Appleton Estate.
- 3 oz Water
- 0.5 oz Lemon juice
- Optional: 0.5 tbsp. Honey if you find the flavor wanting.

# Recipe 1 #

- 8 oz Hot tea (Sleepy time or chamomile preferred, black works too, not green.)
- 1 oz Brandy
- 0.5 oz Lemon juice
- 2 tbsp. Honey

**Substitutions:**
 - Bourbon in place of brandy works just as well, Makers or Jack have shown as such.
 - **NOT SCOTCH** - The bouqet of most scotches would overpower the whole drink.

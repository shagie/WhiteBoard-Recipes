# Recipe 1 #

- 6-8 oz Hot coffee (depending on how strong you want the flavor)
- 1 oz Irish whiskey
- 1 tbsp. Brown sugar
- 0.5 tsp. Cinnamon
- 1 tbsp. Milk or cream of your choosing.

**Substitutions:**
 - Bourbon in place of irish whiskey works just as well.
 - **NOT SCOTCH** - The bouqet of most scotches would overpower the whole drink.
